My reading the input would be big O(N) because it does so inside of one while loop.
My storing of the input would be big O(log N) because the insert function of std::map is logN.
If you consider my read/store as a whole its runtime would be big O(N).


My looking up the final tracking info/deciding on/accessing for output (printing) my "Top Ten" would be big O(N^2).
	This is because of two for loops (nested).

Kind of unsure if this is what you are looking for so I will provide basic rundown below..

	One main while loop to read input. Has a big O(N)
		Map find/map insert inside of while loop. Has a big O(log N)
	Sorting/printing my Top Ten has a for loop nested inside a for loop. Has a big O(N^2)
