<h4 class="style1">Project 6: Word, Number, and Character Usage Statistics</h4>

<p class="style1"><strong>Due: Thurs, Dec 7, 11:59 PM</strong> (100 
Points)</p>

<p class="style1"><b>Important Note: No late submissions will be 
accepted for this one. Dec 7 is the ABSOLUTE DEADLINE, in order to leave 
appropriate time for grading</b></p>

<hr>

<p class="style9"><strong>Objectives: </strong>Practice selecting and 
making use of appropriate STL containers and algorithms to perform 
tasks. </p>


<p class="style9"><strong>Statement of Work:</strong> Implement a 
program that collects the statistics of word, number, and character 
usage in a file (redirected as the standard input).&nbsp; </p>

<p class="style9"><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>

<ol>

     <li>
	<p class="style2"><span class="style7">
        Write a program that will read input (from standard input) until end of input is reached ("end of file"), 
        which will count the number of times each word, number, and character appears in the input.
        </span></p><ul>
         <li>A word is defined as a consecutive sequence of letters ('a'..'z' or 'A'..'Z'). </li>

         <li>Words are case insensitive ("AA", "Aa", "aA", 
	        and "aa" are the same). </li>

         <li>A number is defined as any consecutive sequence of digits ('0'..'9'). </li>
         <li>Note that both words and numbers can be of length of 1, that is, contain one 
             letter or one digit, respectively. </li>

         <li>Different sequences represent different numbers. For example, number "001" is 
             different from number "1". </li>


	 <li>Words are separated by any non-letter characters. </li>

         <li>Numbers are separated by any non-digit characters. </li>
        </ul>

	<br>Output specifications:
        <ul>
         <li>Your program should track the number of times each word, number, and 
         	character appears.</li> 
         <li>The program should then output the ten most used 
	     characters, the ten most used numbers, and the ten most used words, along 
       	     with the number of times each of these characters/numbers/words are used.</li>

        <li> Since words are case insensitive, the program should only output the words in lower case.</li>
        <li>The characters, numbers and words should be printed in descending order 
  	    based on the number of times they are used. </li>
        <li>Breaking ties (for the "Top Tens"):
            <ul>
            <li>When two characters occur the same number of times, the character with the smaller ASCII 
                value should be considered as being used more frequently.</li>
            <li>When two words (or numbers) occur the same number of times, the word (or number) that 
                occurs earlier in the input should be considered as being used more frequently.&nbsp; 
            </li></ul>
        </li>
       </ul>

 <p></p>

	</li>

	<li>

	<p class="style9">An example executable code of the program is provided to 

	you (see below). You should make the outputs of your program match this sample executable.
	When printing characters, use <tt>'\t'</tt> for tab and <tt>'\n'</tt> for newline. 

	All other characters should be printed normally. </p>

	</li>

	<li>

	<p class="style2"><span class="style7">Write a </span> <tt>

	<span class="style7">makefile</span></tt><span class="style7"> for your project that compiles 

	an executable called </span> <tt><span class="style7">proj6.x</span></tt></p>

	</li>

	<li>

	<p class="style9">Make use of any appropriate C++ STL containers and 
	algorithms. You should also use C++ string class instead of default c-strings.
        Here are a few good reference links for the library lookups:
        </p><ul>
         <li><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/">C++ STL Containers</a></li>
         <li><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/">C++ string class library</a></li>
        </ul>
        Note that you should select whatever container(s) will make YOUR program's algorithms the most efficient
        in terms of growth rate (i.e. "Big-O complexity analysis").  
        <p></p>
	</li>

	<li>

	<p class="style9">In a file called <tt>analysis.txt</tt>, write up your analysis of the complexity analysis
        of the important algorithms and procedures in your program.  Note that your analyses will be based on not 
        only the code YOU write, but also on the STL containers you choose for managing your data.  Your analyses
        need to include analysis of at least (but not limited to) each of these necessary tasks:
           </p><ul>
           <li>Reading the input set</li>
	   <li>Storing the characters / words / numbers in your chosen containers, and setting their tracking values</li>
           <li>Looking up the final tracking info on your character / word / number frequencies</li>
           <li>Deciding on (and accessing for output) your "Top Ten" most frequent list for each case</li>
	   <li>Any other important algorithm/tasks you perform to complete the job</li>
           </ul>
        <p></p>
	</li>

	<li>
        <p class="style9">While not a program requirement for 
           submission, it is <i>recommended</i> that you verify your analysis of your program elements by testing larger
           input sets and also by measuring the actual run time speed of those test runs.  You can do this in 
           a program easily by using the <tt>ctime</tt> library and capturing the returns from the <tt>clock()</tt>
           function before and after an algorithm, then subtract the two clock times to see the difference. Conver
           to seconds by dividing by the constant <tt>CLOCKS_PER_SEC</tt>.  On linprog, you can look up more details
           at the manual page for clock (<tt>man clock</tt>).
        </p>
        </li>

</ol>

<p class="style9"><strong>Example executable, some test cases</strong></p>

<blockquote>

	<p class="style7">Download a set of 4 sample test files at
           <a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop4530/hw/hw6files/tests6.tar">this link</a>. This is a tar file containing 4 test files 
              (test0, test1, test2, test3). You will need to unpack this tar file in your project 
              directory. </p>

	<p class="style7">When you create your own executable, you'll need to re-direct any test files
            as the standard input to your program, like this:
            </p><pre>      proj6.x &lt; test0 </pre>
	<p></p>

	<p class="style7">The provided example executable can be run from <tt>linprog</tt>, at the 
            location <tt>~myers/dsprog/proj6.x</tt> . So, for example, you can run the same test file 
            as in the example above with:
            </p><pre>      ~myers/dsprog/proj6.x &lt; test0 </pre>
        <p></p>
</blockquote>

Submission</span></b><span style="mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin" class="style7">

</span></p>

<p class="style8" style="mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin">

Tar all of your source code, as well as your makefile and your analysis.txt file, into a 
single tar archive and submit online via blackboard, using the Assignment 6 link.

</p><p class="style8" style="mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin">
Your tar file should be named in this format, all lowercase:
</p><pre>        <i>lastname</i>_<i>firstname</i>_p6.tar

        Example:  My tar file would be:     <b>myers_bob_p6.tar</b>
</pre>

<span style="mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin" class="style7">

As usual, you should also be able to download your submission and verify if it is correct. 

<o:p></o:p></span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="style8">Note that in addition to the provided test cases, we will also 

test your program using additional test files. Your program must be able to pass 

all the test cases in order to obtain a full score for the corresponding 

components.  Part of the grading will take your choice of STL containers and your complexity 

analyses into account, and testing will involve some larger sets of inputs.</p>
